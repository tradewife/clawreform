## Title
[Project] ClawReform: Open-source AI agent framework that can modify its own codebase through natural language

---

## Body

Hi r/MachineLearning,

Today we're open-sourcing **ClawReform**, an AI agent framework with a unique capability: it can safely modify and improve its own codebase through natural language commands.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/aegntic/clawreform

### What makes ClawReform different?

Most AI agent frameworks are static after deployment. They can't improve without human developers writing code, testing, and deploying updates.

ClawReform introduces a **Self-Modification Kernel** that enables:

- Analyzing its own codebase structure
- Proposing improvements via natural language
- Creating automatic backups
- Applying and validating changes
- Rolling back if anything breaks

All with human-in-the-loop approval workflows and complete audit trails.

### Technical Details

- **Core:** Rust (13 modular crates)
- **Skills:** 61 bundled (DevOps, security, development, data)
- **Hands:** 7 specialized (browser, research, prediction)
- **Channels:** 25+ (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp)
- **MCP:** 23+ Model Context Protocol servers

### Example Usage

```bash
# Start ClawReform
clawreform start

# Ask it to improve itself
clawreform chat "Add a /health endpoint to the API"

# It will:
# 1. Analyze the API structure
# 2. Propose the implementation
# 3. Create a backup
# 4. Apply the changes
# 5. Validate they work
# 6. Rollback if needed
```

### Safety Mechanisms

Self-modification sounds dangerous, so we built multiple safety layers:

- Human approval workflows for critical changes
- Complete audit logs for every modification
- Capability-based permissions
- Sandboxed execution for testing

We'd love feedback from the community on:
1. The self-modification approach
2. Use cases you'd want to see
3. Safety concerns and suggestions

Happy to answer any questions!
